          <h3></h3>
          <p>The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat, keeping the planet warm enough to support life.
Here’s how it works, simply:

The sun sends energy to Earth in the form of sunlight.

Earth absorbs some of this energy and warms up.

Earth then emits some of that energy back into space as heat (infrared radiation).

Greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor) trap some of this heat in the atmosphere.

This trapped heat keeps the planet warmer than it would be without those gases.

Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be too cold for most life.

  <h2>What are the side effects of greenhouse effect</h2>
  <div class="menu-item">
    <h3></h3>
    <p>1. Rising Temperatures
Leads to intense heatwaves that threaten human lives, especially the elderly and children.
Reduces agricultural productivity and affects food supply.
2. Wildfires and Forests
More frequent forest fires due to heat and drought, destroying wildlife and increasing air pollution.
3. Melting Ice and Sea Level Rise
Melting of polar ice causes sea levels to rise.
This threatens coastal cities with flooding and forces people to leave their homes.
4. Increase in Natural Disasters
Hurricanes, floods, and storms are becoming more intense and frequent.
These disasters destroy infrastructure and cost the economy billions.
5. Impact on Agriculture and Wildlife
Unpredictable weather affects crop growth and threatens food security.
Animals struggle to adapt, and some species may go extinct.
6. Human Health Impact
Increases heat-related illnesses like heatstroke.
Spreads new diseases like malaria and dengue due to climate change.
7. Economic Effects
Crop damage, natural disasters, and climate migration lead to huge financial losses.
Higher food and energy prices.

  <h2>how to solve the problem of greenhouse effect </h2>
  <div class="menu-item">
    <h3></h3>
<p>1. Use Renewable Energy
Switch from fossil fuels to solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy.
These sources don’t emit CO₂.
2. Protect and Plant Trees
Forests absorb CO₂, so protecting them (and planting more trees) helps balance emissions.
3. Reduce Transportation Emissions
Use public transport, bikes, electric cars, or carpooling.
Improve fuel efficiency and switch to cleaner fuels.
4. Save Energy at Home
Use LED lights, better insulation, and energy-efficient appliances.
Turn off unused electronics to reduce electricity demand.
5. Change Consumption Habits
Eat less meat (especially beef), as livestock produce methane.
Reduce waste, recycle, and buy locally-made products.
6. Support Clean Technology and Innovation
Support industries and governments that invest in carbon capture, green hydrogen, and sustainable technologies.
7. Support Environmental Policies
Encourage your community and leaders to follow international agreements like the Paris Agreement.
Push for strong laws that limit emissions and protect the environment.
